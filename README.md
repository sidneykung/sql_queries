## Fundamentals

#### Managing Data
- `CREATE TABLE` creates a new table
- `INSERT INTO` adds a new row to a table
- `SELECT` queries data from a table
- `ALTER TABLE` changes an existing table
- `UPDATE` edits a row in a table
- `DELETE FROM` deletes rows from a table

#### Queries
- `SELECT` queries data from a table
- `AS` creates alias for a column or table
- `DISTINCT` returns unique values
- `WHERE` filters the results of the query based on specific conditions
- `LIKE` is used inside of a `WHERE` clause to match a specific pattern
- `BETWEEN` filters by a range of values
- `AND` displays a row if all the conditions are true
- `OR` displays a row if any condition is true
- `ORDER BY` sorts the result
- `LIMIT` specifies the maximum number of rows that the query will return
- `CASE` creates different outputs

#### Multiple Tables
